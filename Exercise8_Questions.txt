Play around with different settings for the analyses outlined above and try to 
answer these questions:
(1) How do trace plots differ if we record samples from every generation or if 
we space out our sampling?

If samples are recorded every generation, the parameter values vary quite a bit around the mean. 
The result is a fuzzy caterpillar. On the other hand, as we space out our samples, it becomes smooth (less variation around the mean).

(2) How does the width of the 95% credible interval change as we add/subtract data?

When adding data, the confidence interval begins to approximate the true value of p.
When subtracting data, the confidence interval begins to deviate from the true value of p.

(3) How does the trace plot change if the proposal window becomes much bigger 
or smaller for a given amount of data?

As the size of the proposal window increases, the chain spends longer periods in one parameter value before changing. The result 
is a trace plot resembling the "Manhattan skyline". If the size of the proposal window is decreased, the trace plot
flattens out substantially. The variation in sampled parameters decreases.
